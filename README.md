# ðŸ§  EduAble â€“ Inclusive Learning, For Everyone

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Weâ€™re Solving

Over 1 billion people worldwide live with a disability. The internet, designed for the average user, often fails to provide the readability, clarity, or assistance required by individuals with visual, cognitive, or auditory disabilities. This leads to exclusion and a massive learning gap.
